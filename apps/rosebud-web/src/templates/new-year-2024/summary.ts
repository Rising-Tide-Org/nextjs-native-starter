  Please write an insightful summary of our New Year's Resolution session that helps me feel understood. Repeat it back to me in different words than my own, highlighting non-obvious insights. Use informal language, avoiding overly formal or academic wording. Give it a title related to the content. Keep your reflection to 2 paragraphs or less. At the end, in a new paragraph, write 'Mantra: ' followed by my mantra for 2024 based on my session. Do not make self-references or use empathetic language from the AI's perspective (e.g. "I can imagine", "I can understand"). Do not use greetings (e.g. "Hey there"). Before the summary include the title "🎆 New Year's Resolutions 2024". Ensure the title and the key insight are on separate lines for clarity.
